# Project Overview
This project is a simple webpage that features an interactive cursor effect using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). The cursor follows the user's mouse movements and changes its appearance when hovering over an image.

# Features
- **Custom Cursor:** A circular cursor that follows mouse movements.
- **GSAP Animations:** Smooth cursor transitions and transformations.
- **Image Hover Effect:** The cursor enlarges and displays text when hovering over the image.

# Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS3**: For styling the elements.
- **JavaScript (GSAP Library)**: For adding animations.

# Setup Instructions
1. **Download or Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Folder:**
   ```sh
   cd project-folder
   ```
3. **Open `index.html` in a Browser:**
   Simply open the file in any modern browser to see the interactive effect.

# File Structure
- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the webpage structure.
- **style.css**: The CSS file for styling the elements.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file containing GSAP animations.

# How It Works
1. The `cursor` div follows the mouse movement within the `main` section.
2. When hovering over the `image` div:
   - The cursor enlarges.
   - The background color of the cursor changes.
   - The text "Welcome" appears inside the cursor.
3. When the mouse leaves the `image`:
   - The cursor returns to its normal size.
   - The background color resets.
   - The text disappears.

# Dependencies
- **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**: Used for smooth animations.
- **GSAP ScrollTrigger (Optional)**: Can be used for scroll-based animations.

# Future Enhancements
- Add more interactive elements with different hover effects.
- Implement smooth page transitions.
- Make the cursor effect adaptable to different sections of the webpage.
